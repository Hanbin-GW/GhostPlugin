GhostPlugin contains most of the plugins I have made into one big plugin in SCP SL.
This is not a free plugin and it is Classfied Plugin in GhostServer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In releases, there is 2 versions available, `GhostPlugin-Eng.dll` and `GhostPlugin.dll`. If you are korean ServerOwner you should use a `GhostPlugin.dll` and if you are english user I strongly recommend to use `GhostPlugin-Eng.dll`

# Plugin List:
