# Development Context (SCP: Secret Laboratory Custom Multiplayer Modding)

In the Unity-based multiplayer game SCP: Secret Laboratory, I do not merely participate as a player—I engage as a developer who disassembles and reconstructs core systems to create new gameplay experiences.

Engine / Language: Unity (C#)

### Key Technologies & Techniques:

- Utilized the CreateSchematic() method to dynamically spawn in-game objects (e.g., shields) in real time at the player’s aiming position.

- Integrated custom modules and self-developed methods to extend game logic.

- Injected Project MER (DLL-based modules) to manipulate server–client logic at runtime.

- Used HarmonyLib with IL injection to modify compiled bytecode for deeper control.

### This type of work requires an advanced understanding of game engine architecture and real-time systems. My implementation includes:

- Raycasting – to detect gaze coordinates for precise object spawning.

- Prefab Instantiation – to dynamically place pre-designed assets into the scene.

- Physics Layers & Colliders – to handle real-time collisions and trigger-based behavior.

- Object Pooling – to minimize garbage collection and ensure memory efficiency.

- Multiplayer Synchronization – to align object state and behavior across server and clients.

### This is a highly complex topic that blends game design with low-level systems control. I implemented it independently, without formal instruction.

Supporting media such as the yellow shield image, demo video, and my public service platform MAMBAB will be included in my online portfolio.
